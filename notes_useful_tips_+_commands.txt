git switch
git annotate
git show
git grep - only searches through the current state of the repo
git log -S - also searches through the changes that happened in history
- accessing github via https may be deprecated in the future
git bisect - find out at which commit something broke in the code
- In commit messages:
  - You can tag the commits that were version releases;
  - It's a good idea to have the first line of the commit message to be short,
    specific, and clear; then add additional descriptive text.
git add -p, git commit -p
- All the materials are public and you can revisit them later. Recordings will be posted on youtube and you can re-watch them. There are other educational initiatives by CodeRefinery that you might want to follow, for example Research Software Hour https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/
